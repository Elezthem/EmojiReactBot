# EmojiReactBot
Discord bot 🖤🤍

To create a bot that responds with emojis in Discord, you can use the **discord.py** library. You'll also need a bot token, which you can obtain by creating an application on the Discord Developer Portal.

Once you paste your token into **client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')** and run this script, the bot will be ready to go.

Please note that this code only responds to the message "👋". You can modify this condition to have the bot respond to different emojis or messages.
